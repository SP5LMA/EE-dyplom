  * There is no need to install anything to make use of LaTeX.
  * Thesis content can be edited at the same time more than one person. It provides possibility to workgroup between Supervisor and Student.
  * It is easy to download resulting PDF file and ZIP package with current thesis.
  * Stable version of this template is distributed in Overleaf as [template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ee-dyplom/qtrkhzdfcfvv).
  * Template version in Overleaf might be outdated to the GitHub version due to delay in updating templates in Overleaf that employs manual verification of template. Therefore Overleaf version might be not fully conformant with current editorial requirements.

## Using template - first steps

1. Template is prepared for XeLaTeX so if you are using Overleaf then open "Menu" and modify "Compiler" to "XeLaTeX" because the default one is different. Compilation with pdfLaTeX was tested and is possible but not recommended. For "manual" compilation of bibliography the biber application should be used.
2. Open file **EE-dyplom.tex** and setup proper type of your thesis in line **documentclass** by modifying value of **thesis** variable choosing of of: **inz**, **mgr**, **bsc**, **msc**
3. Personalize other fields in thee file **EE-dyplom.tex**
4. Modify, change and generate content in the directory **tekst**
5. Add pictures (figures) in the directory **rysunki** (gfx rather should not be used)
